## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: 8 vs 7 
- Total points committed vs. done: 32 vs 30
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): 86h30m vs 77h15m


### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |   8      |       |      24h     |      23h35m        |
| HT-2     | 5 | 2  |6h  |6h40m|
| HT-4     | 2 | 13 |3h  | 3h  |
| HT-5 | 4 | 2 | 9h | 6h |
| HT-6 | 4 | 2 | 7h30m | 3h50m |
| HT-7 |  4 | 2 | 8h| 7h50m |
| HT-8 | 4 | 5 | 9h | 9h20m |
| HT-9 | 5 | 3 | 9h30m | 10h20m |
| HT-10 | 5 | 3 | 10h30m | 8h15m |
| Total | 41 | 32 | 86h30m | 77h15m |
   

- Hours per task average : 1h53m
- standard deviation for tasks: 
    - Estimated : 1h5m
    - Real : 1h22m
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1
    - 86h30m / 77h15m - 1 = 0,119

  
## QUALITY MEASURES

  - Total hours estimated: 19h
  - Total hours spent: 17h25m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 19
  - Coverage (if available)
- **E2E testing:**
  - Total hours estimated: 2h30m
  - Total hours spent: 2h30m
- **Code review** 
  - Total hours estimated: 8h
  - Total hours spent: 10h
  


## ASSESSMENT

- **What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?**

    For this sprint, we slightly overestimated the overall time that we were going to take to complete the tasks. This is because we wanted to avoid repeating mistakes from the previous sprint. In fact, in the last sprint, we slightly underestimated the planning part and we did not take into consideration possible misunderstandings of user stories which would lead to extra time spent. 

- **What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?**

    *Positive* : 
    - Better use of Youtrack which makes retrospectives and planning easier.
    - Finishing coding earlier makes room for a better demo preparation.
    
    *Negative* : 
    - Initially we overlooked some tasks, which we were forced to add during the Sprint because they were essential. We need to be more careful during the planning not to omit any work a User Story requires.
    - We should try to realize perfect stories in order to minimize the technical debt for the future. We probably will not be able to commit to as many stories for Sprint 3 because of necessary improvements on the implemented stories.
    - It is crucial we test absolutely everything that is shown in the demo, to avoid mistakes.
    
- **Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?**
    - We were able to better plan the sprint based on the use of working pairs : two people working together, respectively on the front and backend of a given user story.
    - We improved the merging process, with a more continuous integration of the stories and functionalities. It is not yet perfect, but remains much better than the previous Sprint.
    - We spent more time discussing the Stories and asking about them to the Product Owner, which helped us avoid making mistakes.
  
- **Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?**
    - We still struggled estimating correctly the User Stories. The points given to the commited User Stories were closer to the real time spent, however we still overlooked and/or overestimated certain tasks.
    
    
- **Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)**

    - Reserve some more time for improvements and bug fixes. This necessary work is a consequence to the technical debt we evoked in the previous answers.
    - Aim for Zero Default in the implemented User Stories.
    - Organize better the available time for testing and documentation.

- **One thing you are proud of as a Team!!**

    - We greatly improved our productivity compared to the last Sprint, getting less stuck on tasks and using our time more efficiently.
